# Data Professionals Trends Analysis â€“ Power BI Project

This Power BI project analyzes trends related to data-related jobs using LinkedIn data.

Data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query, and custom KPIs were created with DAX measures.  
The repository includes the `.pbix` Power BI file, the original Excel dataset, and a PDF presentation of the dashboard.  
Dynamic visualizations provide a clear and intuitive overview of market trends in the data field.  
The project demonstrates the use of Business Intelligence tools for efficient data exploration and insight generation.  
 
Each component of the dashboard is designed for clarity, usability, and impact.
